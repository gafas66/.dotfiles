We should have much less color errors (E1/E2)
Much less, some 240 errors still in sea-of gates, all M2_E1
** DONE Introduce place block under M3/M2 contacts to avoid DRC's (color)

This is not possible - will create 53k blockages, severly limiting
placement freedom. Better perhaps solve by deleting violating vias at end?
** DONE Why is input CLK_REF_IN_N from serdes driven directly?

An inverter is apparently driving this input pin at BUMP
In the phy_tc this is driven by primary input, in c2c by clock tree - pin is both bump !
According to Claudia, W/E are for connected parallell serdes, in: should perhaps be tied off
Main clock bump should have a create_clock on it, N version generated -invert
** TODO Check serdes CLK_REF_IN_N def's with Chenming
