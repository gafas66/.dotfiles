** TODO [#A] Avoid serdes clock routing
SCHEDULED: <2024-11-22 Fri>
Does not happen on pcie -> unknown why, clocks seem to be treated identically.
** DONE Rerun calibre
CLOSED: [2024-11-21 Thu 12:22] SCHEDULED: <2024-11-21 Thu>
** DONE Check c2c calibre results
CLOSED: [2024-11-21 Thu 16:46] SCHEDULED: <2024-11-21 Thu>
We should have much less color errors (E1/E2)
Much less, some 240 errors still in sea-of gates, all M2_E1
** DONE Introduce place block under M3/M2 contacts to avoid DRC's (color)
CLOSED: [2024-11-21 Thu 18:02] SCHEDULED: <2024-11-21 Thu>
This is not possible - will create 53k blockages, severly limiting
placement freedom. Better perhaps solve by deleting violating vias at end?
** DONE Why is input CLK_REF_IN_N from serdes driven directly?
CLOSED: [2024-11-21 Thu 17:19] SCHEDULED: <2024-11-21 Thu>
An inverter is apparently driving this input pin at BUMP
In the phy_tc this is driven by primary input, in c2c by clock tree - pin is both bump !
According to Claudia, W/E are for connected parallell serdes, in: should perhaps be tied off
Main clock bump should have a create_clock on it, N version generated -invert
** DONE Check serdes CLK_REF_IN_N def's with Chenming
CLOSED: [2024-11-22 Fri 12:17] SCHEDULED: <2024-11-22 Fri>
Sent t-msg to Chenming 22-nov
Can we find a temp solution? Workaround? Disconnect, then connect to port?
What is the port name ? Does the port exist? PCIE vs C2C?
*** TODO Wait for CS response to solve issue
SCHEDULED: <2024-11-25 Mon>

** TODO Change phy-ver flow to include $impl
SCHEDULED: <2024-11-29 Fri>
** TODO How do we deal with 50 macro placement false warnings?
SCHEDULED: <2024-11-28 Thu>
** DONE Remove M2 from rails and only use M1 like STXMOD -> solve M2 color isse
CLOSED: [2024-11-22 Fri 11:50] SCHEDULED: <2024-11-22 Fri>
Actually the same via is in STXMOD, so this serves no purpose.

* Debug notes
** CLK_REF_IN_N on c2c
Serdes inserted in block#1 c2c_chi_asic...
Driven by direct input (no bufs)
phy_clk_ref_in_n is the port name
This is driven by CTS-net on top-level
E=EAST, W=WEST, placed e/w in G1 -> unconnected in PHY_TC
